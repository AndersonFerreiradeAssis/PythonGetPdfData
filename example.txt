It was a dark and stormy night, and Sarah was driving home from 
a long day at work. She had always been afraid of driving in the 
dark, but she had no choice this time. Her car was the only source 
of light in the darkness, and the sound of the rain hitting the roof 
was the only thing she could hear. 
 
As she drove down the deserted road, she suddenly noticed a 
figure standing on the side of the road. She rubbed her eyes, 
thinking it was just her imagination playing tricks on her, but 
when she looked back, the figure was still there. She slowed 
down to get a better look, but the figure suddenly vanished into 
the darkness. 
 
Sarah felt a chill run down her spine, and she quickly accelerated, 
trying to get away from the figure. But as she drove, she started to 
see more and more figures standing along the road, as if they were 
trying to guide her towards something. She became more and 
more afraid, and she wished she had never left her house that 
night. 
 
As she drove deeper into the darkness, she suddenly found herself 
in front of an old abandoned house. The figures she had seen 
earlier were standing in front of the house, beckoning her to come 
closer. She felt a strong urge to run, but her feet wouldn't listen to 
her. She was drawn towards the house, and before she knew it, 
she was standing in front of the entrance. 
 
The door creaked open, and Sarah hesitantly stepped inside. The 
interior was dark and musty, and she could hear strange noises 
coming from the other side of the room. She took a step forward, 
and suddenly the floorboards beneath her gave way. She fell into Page 2
a deep pit, and she could feel herself descending further and 
further into the darkness. 
 
She finally landed with a thud, and she found herself in a dark 
room. The room was filled with strange and terrifying creatures, 
and Sarah could feel their eyes on her, watching her every move. 
She tried to scream, but no sound came out of her mouth. She was 
completely paralyzed with fear, and she could feel the creatures 
slowly closing in on her. 
 
Just as they were about to grab her, she woke up with a start. It 
was just a nightmare, she thought, and she was relieved to be back 
in her own bed. But as she tried to get up, she realized that she 
was still in the dark room from her nightmare. She was still 
surrounded by the strange and terrifying creatures, and she was 
unable to move. 
 
Sarah screamed for help, but no one answered. She was trapped in 
the dark room, with no escape from the creatures that surrounded 
her. She could feel their breath on her skin, and she could hear 
their whispers in her ear. She was never seen or heard from again, 
and no one knows what happened to her. 
 
To this day, people say that if you drive down that deserted road 
on a dark and stormy night, you might come across the old 
abandoned house, and you might hear the scream of a young 
woman coming from the depths of the darkness. But no one ever 
dares to venture inside, for fear of never coming back.
